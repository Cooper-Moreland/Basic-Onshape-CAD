## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second part of the castor is the mount. The dimensions were 120 mm x 120 mm x 8 mm thick. It has 5 holes with one central one which is 25 mm in diameter and 4 in a linear pattern around the square.

I'm really enjoying making parts in Onshape and can't wait to assemble them all.

## Fork

### Description

The third part of the castor is the fork. The first sektch was a circle which was another simple extrusion, followed by a skinny, long rectangle which I extruded and mirrored. I added to fillets to the first sketch and its mirror, and a third fillet which was inverted to make the first and second sketch flow into each other. I then created a sketch on one of the faces of the second sketch in order to create a hole in both pieces. The final important part I added was a long extrusion of a circle on the bottom of the fork.

I learned that you are able to put a whole through two objects with one command.

## Tire

### Description

This was the fourth part of the castor in Onshape. It was simply one circular sketch followed by a revolve. After that I added fillets to the edges of the tire.

I learned how to add fillets to objects in Onshape.

## Wheel and Bearings

### Description

This was my sixth part of the castor in Onshape. It started with a sketch similar to an upper case ¨I,¨ followed by a revolve and a circular sketch with multiple circles in it. I added three lines going out from the center and extruded those and made a circular pattern to create the holes in the wheel. I then added fillets to the edges of the wholes to make them look cleaner. For the Bearings, I made two circles lined up with the center of the wheel, (one smaller) and extruded them.

I learned how to do advanced extrudes and make sketches on top of extrudes more efficiently.

## Axle and Collar

### Description

This was the seventh part of the castor in Onshape. I started with a circle, which I extruded, I then made a rectangle on the top of the first extrude. I added a blind extrude of a rectangle on the top and mirrored it to the other side. For the bearing I sketched a circle on the edge of the first extrude and extruded that circle. Finally, I put a through all extrude to make a whole through the bearing.
